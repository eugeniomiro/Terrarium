                The current server is undergoing a bit of a fixup so peers and connections from time to time may experience outages.</li>

                There are several artifacts and drawing problems that occur when running Terrarium via Remote Desktop 
                Connection. Things like tool tips in the wrong spot or clipped, the world view being rendered incorrectly are a couple of known problems. </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 6;"><b>64-bit is not supported for the client.</b><br />
                Unfortunately running on 64-bit machines is not supported at this time. This has to do with the 
                COM-Interop that Terrarium uses for interfacing with DirectDraw.</li>
