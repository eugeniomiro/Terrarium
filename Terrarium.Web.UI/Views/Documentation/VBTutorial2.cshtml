<h2>Lab 1: Create a Herbivore</h2>
<h3>Lab Objective </h3>
<p>The objective of this lab is to build a fully functional organism for Terrarium.  
    You will begin by creating a simple organism and then add more advanced functionality.  
    Once you are happy with the way it is performing, you can introduce it to the Terrarium 
    Ecosystem and have it compete against other attendees’ organisms.</p>

<h3>Exercise 2 – Handling an Attacked Event</h3>
<p>In this hands-on lab you will use the event model of the Terrarium to handle an Attacked event.  
    An Attacked event is fired when you are attacked by another animal. This is just one of the many events 
    that you can handle, to see the full list, refer to the Organism Documentation.
</p>
<p>Please substitute your name wherever you see the text &lt;YOUR NAME&gt; below since each animal introduced into the 
    .NET Terrarium must have a unique name. 
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <h4>Open the animal you created in @Html.ActionLink("Exercise 1 (Simple Herbivore)", "VBTutorial", new { id = 1 }) </h4>
        <br /><br />
        <ul>
            <li>Click Start-&gt;All Programs-&gt;Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003-&gt;Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003</li>
            <li>Select File | Open | Project.  This will open the standard file open dialogue.</li>
            <li>Browse to the folder where you saved the project in Exercise 1. </li>
            <li>Click the file named &lt;YOUR NAME&gt; and then click Open.</li>
            <li>If the source file does not open in the main window, double-click the MyAnimal.cs icon from the 
                Solution Explorer window. The source then opens in the main window</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Subscribe to the AttackedEvent.</h4>
        <p>The AttackedEvent is fired when your animal is attacked by another animal.  This line tells the game engine 
            to call the MyAnimal_Attacked method each time the AttackedEvent is fired.  Add the following line to the 
            Initialize method: </p>
        <code>AddHandler Attacked, AddressOf MyAnimal_Attacked</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Add the AttackedEvent handler.</h4>
        <p>When your animal is attacked, it first tries to defend itself against its attacker.  It then tries to run 
            away from the attacker by moving to a random location on the game board.  Add the following method to the 
            MyAnimal class. </p>
        <code><pre>
    ' Fired if we're being attacked 
    Sub MyAnimal_Attacked(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As AttackedEventArgs)
        If (e.Attacker.IsAlive) Then
            Dim TheAttacker As AnimalState = e.Attacker
            BeginDefending(TheAttacker) 'defend against the attacker 
 
            WriteTrace("Run away to some random point")
            Dim x As Integer = OrganismRandom.Next(0, WorldWidth - 1)
            Dim y As Integer = OrganismRandom.Next(0, WorldHeight - 1)
            BeginMoving(New MovementVector(New Point(x, y), 10))
        End If
    End Sub
</pre></code>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Rename and Build the animal DLL.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Select Project Properties.  This will open the Project Properties dialog.</li>
            <li>In Common Properties | General, change the Assembly Name field to &lt;YOUR NAME&gt;_Ex2 and click OK.</li>
            <li>Build the animal DLL from within the IDE by selecting Build | Build Solution</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Introduce the Herbivore into the Terrarium in Terrarium Mode.</h4>
        <p>Terrarium supports two game modes, Terrarium mode and Ecosystem mode.  </p>
        <p>In Ecosystem mode, your animal competes against animals submitted by other developers.  </p>
        <p>Terrarium mode is the Terrarium test mode.  In Terrarium mode you can test your animal in a 
            controlled environment.</p>
        <p>To switch to Terrarium Mode, click the New Terrarium button.  Enter Lab01 as the name and click Save.  
            This will restart the client in Terrarium mode.</p>
        <img src="~/content/documentation/images/tutorial_image001.jpg" alt="New Terrarium" />
        <p>The next step is to add some plants into the Terrarium so that your Herbivore will have something to eat 
            when it is introduced. To do that, click on the Add button, then click the Server List button and you will 
            get a list of several animals that have already been introduced.</p>
        <img src="~/content/documentation/images/tutorial_image002.jpg" alt="Add Animal" />
        <p>For the purpose of this lab, and as is usual in the real world, there are several plant species you can 
            choose from. Simply select any of the species of Type “plant” and click OK. This will introduce 10 plants 
            of the type you selected to the Terrarium. </p>
        <img src="~/content/documentation/images/tutorial_image003.jpg" alt="Insert Animal" />
        <p>Finally introduce your animal. To do this, click on Add button click Browse and browse to the dll you created 
        (&lt;YOUR NAME&gt;.dll). This dll will be located in the Bin folder of your project.</p>
        <p>You should see 10 instances of your creature in the Terrarium.  To add more, you can use the Combo Box and 
            Insert button like you did with the plants.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Exercise Summary</h3>
<p>In this Exercise, you’ve modified your Herbivore to be able to detect when it is being attacked and to respond to 
    this attack. </p>
