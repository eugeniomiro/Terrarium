<h2>Lab 1: Create a Herbivore</h2>
<h3>Lab Objective </h3>
<p>The objective of this lab is to build a fully functional organism for Terrarium.  
    You will begin by creating a simple organism and then add more advanced functionality.  
    Once you are happy with the way it is performing, you can introduce it to the Terrarium 
    Ecosystem and have it compete against other attendees’ organisms.</p>

<h3>Exercise 3 – Communication</h3>
<p>In this hands-on lab you will use the animal’s Antenna property to communicate with other animals.  
    The state of the antenna is visible to all animals.  By changing the value of the antenna your animal can 
    communicate with the other animals in the Ecosystem.  In this lab, you will update your animal to signal 
    when another animal is blocking a target plant.  In response, the blocking animal will move out of the way, 
    giving your animal access to the target plant.
</p>
<p>Please substitute your name wherever you see the text &lt;YOUR NAME&gt; below since each animal introduced into 
    the .NET Terrarium must have a unique name.

        <h4>Open the animal you created in Exercise 1 (Simple Herbivore)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Click Start->All Programs->Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003->Microsoft Visual Studio  .NET 2003</li>
            <li>Select File | Open | Project.  This will open the standard file open dialogue. </li>
            <li>Browse to the folder where you saved the project in Exercise 2. </li>
            <li>Click the file named &lt;YOUR NAME&gt; and then click Open.</li>
            <li>If the source file does not open in the main window, double-click the MyAnimal.cs icon from the 
                Solution Explorer window. The source then opens in the main window</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Subscribe to the MoveCompletedEvent</h4>
        <p>The MoveCompletedEvent is fired when your animal has stopped moving.  This line tells the game engine to 
            call the MyAnimal_MoveCompleted method each time the MoveCompletedEvent is fired.</p>
        <code>MoveCompleted +=new MoveCompletedEventHandler(MyAnimal_MoveCompleted);</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Add the MoveCompletedEvent handler.</h4>
        <p>There are two reasons an animal will complete its move event; the animal has reached its destination or 
            its path is blocked.  If the animal’s path is being blocked, we want to signal the blocking animal to 
            move out of the way.  The signal we use is the antenna value of 13.  Add the following method to the 
            MyAnimal class. </p>
        <code><pre>
// Fired when we've finished moving.
private void MyAnimal_MoveCompleted(object sender, MoveCompletedEventArgs e)
{
    // Reset the antenna value
    this.Antennas.AntennaValue = 0;
    
    // If we've stopped because something is blocking us...
    if (e.Reason == ReasonForStop.Blocked)
    { 
        WriteTrace("Something's blocking my way.");
        if (e.BlockingOrganism is AnimalState)
        { 
            AnimalState blockingAnimal = (AnimalState)e.BlockingOrganism;
            if (blockingAnimal.AnimalSpecies.IsSameSpecies(this.Species))
            { 
                // Signal to our friend to move out of our way.
                WriteTrace("One of my friends is blocking my way.  I'll ask him to move.");
                this.Antennas.AntennaValue = 13;
            }
        }
    }
}

              </pre></code>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Add the logic to move out of the way when blocking our friends.  </h4>
        <p>On every turn, we need to look around for animals signaling they’re being blocked.  
            The ShouldIMoveForMyFriend method looks for animals signaling “13.”  If any are found, the animal moves 
            out of the way of the blocked animal.  Add the following method to the MyAnimal class. </p>
        <code><pre>
// Routine to move out of the way when blocking our friends.
void ShouldIMoveForMyFriend()
{
    try
    {
        ArrayList foundAnimals = Scan();
 
        if (foundAnimals.Count > 0)
        {
            foreach (OrganismState organismState in foundAnimals)
            {
                if (organismState is AnimalState)
                {
                    AnimalState visibleAnimal = (AnimalState)organismState;

                    // Only move if the animal is one of our friends (IsSameSpecies).
                    if (visibleAnimal.Species.IsSameSpecies(this.Species))
                    {
                        // If the animal's antenna value is 13, it means they're blocked (see the MoveCompletedEvent method).
                        if (visibleAnimal.Antennas.AntennaValue == 13)
                        {
                            // We're blocking our friend, so we should move.
                            WriteTrace("I'm blocking one of my friends.  I should move.");
 
                            int newX = this.Position.X - (visibleAnimal.Position.X - this.Position.X);
                            int newY = this.Position.Y - (visibleAnimal.Position.Y - this.Position.Y);
 
                            BeginMoving(new MovementVector(new Point(newX, newY), 2));
                            return;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    catch (Exception exc)
    {
        WriteTrace(exc.ToString());

        <h4>Call the ShouldIMoveForMyFriend() method at the end of each turn.</h4>
        <p>At the end of every turn, we need to call the ShouldIMoveForMyFriend method to unblock any of our friends.  
            Since the IdleEvent is fired on each turn, add a call to the ShouldIMoveForMyFriend method at the end of the 
            MyAnimal_Idle method.  Add the following method call as the last line of the MyAnimal_Idle method. </p>
        <code>ShouldIMoveForMyFriend()</code>

        <h4>Rename and Build the animal DLL.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Select Project | Properties.  This will open the Project Properties dialog.</li>
            <li>In Common Properties | General, change the Assembly Name field to &lt;YOUR NAME&gt;_Ex3.</li>
            <li>Build the animal DLL from within the IDE by selecting Build | Make Solution</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

        <h4>Introduce the Herbivore into the Terrarium in Terrarium Mode.</h4>
        <p>Terrarium supports two game modes, Terrarium mode and Ecosystem mode.  </p>
        <p>In Ecosystem mode, your animal competes against animals submitted by other developers.  </p>
        <p>To switch to Terrarium Mode, click the New Terrarium button.  Enter Lab01 as the name and click Save.  
            This will restart the client in Terrarium mode.</p>
        <img src="~/content/documentation/images/tutorial_image001.jpg" alt="New Terrarium" />
        <p>The next step is to add some plants into the Terrarium so that your Herbivore will have something to eat 
            when it is introduced. To do that, click on the Add button, then click the Server List button and you will 
            get a list of several animals that have already been introduced.</p>
        <img src="~/content/documentation/images/tutorial_image002.jpg" alt="Add Animal" />
        <p>For the purpose of this lab, and as is usual in the real world, there are several plant species you can 
            choose from. Simply select any of the species of Type “plant” and click OK. This will introduce 10 plants 
            of the type you selected to the Terrarium. </p>
        <img src="~/content/documentation/images/tutorial_image003.jpg" alt="Insert Animal" />
        <p>Finally introduce your animal. To do this, click on Add button click Browse and browse to the dll you 
            created (&lt;YOUR NAME&gt;.dll). This dll will be located in the Bin folder of your project.</p>
        <p>You should see 10 instances of your creature in the Terrarium.  To add more, you can use the Combo Box 
            and Insert button like you did with the plants.</p>
        <p>To test the new functionality, increase the population of your animal by clicking the Insert button.  
            Notice that when one of your animals is blocked from a food source, the blocking animal moves out 
            of the way.</p>
    </li>

<h3>Exercise Summary</h3>
<p>Your Herbivores are now talking to each other.  You could now take communication and combine it with the attacked 
    event logic.  Maybe you can have your herbivore signal to all of his friends that he is being attacked and they 
    should all come and help.  Or they should all run away!
